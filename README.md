# weather-app

I created a weather app using an API from openweather.org.

The app was created with HTML, CSS and the API was handled with Javascript. This was created to help me better my understanding of API and how to use them in a program. I learned to use object oriented programming to write clean code and layout a clean user interface with CSS.

I utilized the flexbox method to make the page responsive and better my efficiency of CSS.

This is the first iteration of my weather app. I plan on making another one that utilizes Node with a interface of a modern weather app.
